Your name: Andrea Ola Mejicanos 
Question 2: The amount of memory is 7960 megabytes, and the amount of free memory is 5383. This numbers do match my intuition 
since I am not currently using all the memory and I know that the RAM of my laptop is 8Gb.

Question 4: The amount of memory used shifted from 776 to 746 after the process was killed. The numbers do match the expectation 
since the number of megabytes that I used as input was 30.

Question 6: In order to get the PID I added a line of code to memory-user program to print the PID to the screen. Then, while that process was running, I used pmap with that PID.

Question 7: I observed memory-user, heap, stack, vvar, vdso, anon, and vsycall.

Question 8: After running memory-user several times, with different amounts of used memory (10,20,30,100), the output of pmap oly shows a change in [anon] memory,
 and it increases as the memory used by memory-user changes. I am not certain about why the change happens in anon memory,
 but it does makes snese since this valu changes based on the amount of memory that we are giving to memory-user.
